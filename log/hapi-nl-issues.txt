TWINS2_OR_DEF not in bw

Due to data and eflux being time varying. Nand generally drops bins
for this case, but here he did not. Here he uses integers. Why
does he keep for this case?

Due to Nand having DATA_QUALITY and Gain1 having same time variable, but this is not correct.

ParticleDir_SM dropped because one of its DEPEND_2 variable (NumAxisFixed) does
not have a VAR_TYPE. In principle, knowing the VAR_TYPE is not needed because
(NumAxis does not have a VAR_TYPE. I think it did not cause a problem because it is used as a label pointer.)
